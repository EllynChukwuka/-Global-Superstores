Introduction
Objective of the Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the sales performance of the Global Superstores dataset across different regions, states, cities, product categories, and customer profiles. Additionally, the project aims to forecast future sales trends to assist in data-driven decision-making for operational and strategic planning.

Problem Being Addressed
The organization seeks to understand:

Which regions and states contribute most to revenue
Which cities perform best
Who the top customers are
Which product categories drive profit
Sales progression over time
Forecasted performance for the next two years
This analysis addresses the broader challenge of optimizing business operations, inventory, and marketing strategy.

Key Datasets & Methodologies
Dataset includes:

Order dates
Region and state information
City-level sales
Customer names
Product categories and sales
Tools & methods used:

Tableau for data visualization
Time-series forecasting
Sales aggregation
line charts, pie charts, and bubble charts
3. Story of Data
Data Source
The dataset is modeled after the well-known Global Superstore dataset used in analytics and BI training. It typically originates from internal sales systems such as ERP or POS solutions.

Data Collection Process
Data is collected from transactional order records stored in the company’s internal data warehouse. Each row represents a single sales transaction.

Data Structure
Rows: individual customer orders
Columns: order date, region, product category, sub-category, city, state, customer name, and sales amount
Important Features & Their Significance
Feature Importance Order Date Enables time-series and forecasting analysis Region / State / City Geographic sales comparison Product Category Identifies revenue-driving segments Customer Name Customer performance analysis Sales Amount Primary measure of business output

Data Limitations or Biases
Potential seasonal biases (e.g., Q4 spikes)
Possible inconsistencies in customer names (e.g., duplicates)
No explicit cost/margin data, limiting profit analysis
Forecast accuracy limited by available historical length
4. Data Splitting & Preprocessing
Data Cleaning
Typical cleaning steps (performed prior to visualization):

Removing duplicate transactions
Ensuring consistent date formats
Standardizing category names
Removing negative/erroneous entries
Handling Missing Values
Some fields — like customer segment or city — may be incomplete. Approaches used:

Imputation with known category values when possible
Row removal if fields were critical but missing
Data Transformations
Aggregated sales by region, state, and city
Extracted year and quarter from the date
Grouped product categories
Created forecasting model using Tableau’s built-in forecast engine
Data Splitting
Independent Variables: Region, City, Category, Customer, Quarter
Dependent Variable: Sales
Industry Context
The dataset represents the retail industry, where revenue, customer behavior, and product performance analytics are central to business strategy.

5. Pre-Analysis
Identify Key Early Trends
Initial dashboard review shows:

Sales steadily increased from 2015 to 2018
Eastern region drives the highest sales
California and New York City show exceptional performance
Technology category is the largest revenue contributor
Potential Correlations
Higher urban population → higher city sales
Technology category correlates with increased overall sales
Customers with repeated purchases generate most revenue
Initial Insights
Q4 spikes indicate seasonal demand
Western and Eastern regions both show growth trends
Customer sales concentration suggests top customers account for a large share
6. In-Analysis
Unconfirmed Insights (Hypotheses)
California’s disproportionately high sales may be due to higher order density and larger average order value
Technology product sales may drive seasonality in Q4
Some customers consistently outperform others, suggesting loyalty
Recommendations from Emerging Patterns
Increase marketing spend in California and New York City
Ensure stock levels are highest in Q3–Q4 for peak demand
Consider loyalty programs for high-value customers
Visualized in Tableau
Pivot tables for regional/category breakdown
VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP for customer merging
FORECAST for projections
Conditional formatting for trend detection
7. Post-Analysis & Insights
Key Findings
Sales Growth: A strong upward trend from 2015–2018
Regional Performance: East region leads, West follows
State Performance: California dominates with over $446K in sales
Top Cities: New York City is the highest contributor
Customer Insights: A handful of customers generate the majority of revenue
Category Performance: Technology leads ($827K+), followed by Furniture and Office Supplies
Forecasting: Predicted continued growth through 2019–2020
Comparison with Initial Findings
Seasonal trends were confirmed
Geographic sales distribution matched expectations (urban dominance)
Some customers performed better than initially anticipated
8. Data Visualizations & Charts
Visualizations included in the dashboard:

Sales Progression by Region (Line/Area Chart)
Shows year-over-year growth across East, West, and other regions.
Sales by State (Map Visualization)
Highlights top states (California, Washington, Pennsylvania).
Sales by City (Bubble Chart)
Indicates New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle as top cities.
Customer Performance Metrics (Tree Map)
Displays highest-value customers.
